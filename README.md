**About**

Software developer with over 13 years of experience in backend and frontend development. I’ve contributed to a
wide range of projects, including e-commerce platforms, vehicle rental systems, and telematics solutions. My
responsibilities included full-stack development, collaborating with business stakeholders, and mentoring junior
developers. I’m well-versed in building microservices architectures using Node.js, SQL/NoSQL databases, message
brokers, and integrating with external APIs. I’m continually expanding my knowledge in system design and
modern technologies. I also enjoy practicing my skills on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/idubininmail/) and sharing insights on my [blog](https://dev.to/igorok).
